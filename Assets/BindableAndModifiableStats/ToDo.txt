Need to make another scriptable object for global modifiers, like 10% health. When 'equipped' it should add a modifier
to all stats of its type.

Finish adding stats to Equipment example
    -Set up equip/unequip
Make all additions to StatList create a new instance of the SO
Add controls from Stat SO to StatList, so they can be edited without the SO being accessible
    -Or add an object field to double click it?

Add method to StatList to add a List<CharacterStat>
    -If stat exists, add new stats as modifier with source
    -If not, add stat with source
    
Fix Script namespaces
    -Com.PI.BAMS
    -Com.PI.BAMS.Examples
Clean up/refactor custom editor code
Moar Examples!
    -Example showing simple health bar example, but with flat health modifiers, to show source of each damage event
    -Example buffs. Maybe inherit from CharacterStat and add a timer?
